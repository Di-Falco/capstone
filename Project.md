# Blockbuster: Revengeance

### A website inspired by moviemadness.org and dedicated to the lost era of the video rental store.

## Minimum Viable Product:

* Landing page with header, Display new additions or employee recommendations etc.
* Database of movies in stock
* List of all in-stock movies where each item links to its detail page. Movie details might include title, year, poster image, director, cast/crew, country of origin/ language, description, in/out of stock, format(DVD/BluRay/VHS/LaserDisc/BetaMax/Capacitance Electronic Disc/16, 35, 70mm Film/ etc)
* Page for upcoming screenings
* Uses either IMDB or TMDB database to get movie info
* Some slick styling with an as-of-yet-undertermined library
* User login to register for screenings or reserve titles for rent

## Technologies

* React / Redux
* Firebase
* Tailwind CSS
* IMDB or TMDB API
* More TBD

## Stretch Goals

* Add extra features to user accounts, possible profile personalization, history of rented titles, display page for favorite movies, etc.
* Similarly, add user data to movie details pages, including user ratings/review, comments, etc.
* Add custom displays for film based on the film's format, ie movies on VHS would appear differently from films on DVD or LaserDisc
* Add a page where users can watch the 1963 movie _Charade_, which was famously entered into the public domain immediately upon its release owing to a loophole in the copyright laws at the time and is viewable in its entirety on its own wikipedia article.
* Incorporate functionality from letterboxd.com to connect users with their pre-exisiting movie logs and profile personalization.
* more TBD

# Project History

### 9/16/2022

* Set up create-react-app with placeholder components for displaying the movie list and movie detail pages
* Write first draft of project proposal
* Look into API fetch with React
* Install Tailwind, then second guess my decision and look into alternatives
* Since upcoming lessons cover some topics I need to use to meet my MVP, day one is mostly about setting the groundwork for my styles / layout. I might opt to use SASS instead of Tailwind so I can have greater control over the appearance of the site.
